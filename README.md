# PICT Website Review Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of student reviews of the PICT (Pune Institute of Computer Technology) website. The analysis aims to evaluate various aspects of the website, including UI design, color scheme, responsiveness, and accessibility, based on feedback from more than 97 students gathered through a Google Form.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of responses from students, collected via a multiple-choice questionnaire and an open-ended question soliciting their opinions on the PICT website. The questionnaire covered aspects such as UI, color, responsiveness, and accessibility.

## Findings

1. **Content Satisfaction**: The majority of students rated the content of the website favorably, with most giving it a score of 4 out of 5. This indicates that the website provides satisfactory information and notices regarding college and events.

2. **UI Design**: Students expressed dissatisfaction with the UI design, with ratings ranging from 2 to 3 out of 5. There is a demand for change, particularly regarding the dark blue color scheme.

3. **Accessibility and Responsiveness**: Both accessibility and responsiveness received an average rating of 3 out of 5. There is room for improvement in these areas, such as organizing content hierarchically and implementing more media query tags to enhance responsiveness.

4. **Color Scheme**: The color scheme of the website received a poor rating from students, indicating an urgent need for improvement.

## Sentiment Analysis

To complement the quantitative analysis, sentiment analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses provided by the students. This involved the use of natural language processing techniques to derive sentiments about the website based on the text provided. The sentiment analysis revealed additional insights into students' opinions and helped corroborate findings from the quantitative analysis.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **UI Redesign**: Consider redesigning the UI to address student dissatisfaction, particularly focusing on the color scheme.
  
- **Improving Accessibility and Responsiveness**: Enhance accessibility by organizing content more effectively and improve responsiveness by implementing additional media query tags.

- **Color Scheme Improvement**: Prioritize updating the color scheme of the website to improve user experience.
